# Test Status Report

**Last Updated:** June 21, 2025  
**Branch:** devin/1750543497-fix-async-foreach-test-framework  
**Test Framework:** Jest with custom FixtureTestUtils  

## Current Test Results

After fixing the async forEach bug in the test framework:

```
Test Suites: 1 failed, 250 passed, 251 total
Tests:       1 failed, 263 passed, 264 total
Time:        20.402 seconds
```

**Pass Rate:** 99.6% (263/264 tests passing)

## Test Framework Fix Impact

The async forEach bug fix in `packages/deparser/test-utils/index.ts` has revealed a previously hidden deparser issue:

### Previously Hidden Failures Now Detected

- **`misc-launchql-ext-types.test.ts`** - Now properly fails due to deparser generating invalid SQL with missing closing quotes in regex patterns

### Root Cause of Test Framework Bug

The test framework was using `tree.stmts.forEach(async (stmt: any) => {` which doesn't properly await async operations. Errors thrown inside the async callback were "fire-and-forget" and never bubbled up to fail tests.

**Fixed by:** Converting to proper `for...of` loop to ensure async operations are awaited and errors are properly caught.

## Failing Tests

### 1. misc-launchql-ext-types.test.ts
- **Status:** FAILING (Expected - reveals real deparser bug)
- **Issue:** Deparser drops closing quotes from regex patterns in CREATE DOMAIN CHECK constraints
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  -- Input SQL:
  CREATE DOMAIN attachment AS jsonb CHECK (value ?& ARRAY['url', 'mime'] AND (value ->> 'url') ~ E'^(https?)://[^\\s/$.?#].[^\\s]*$')
  
  -- Deparsed SQL (missing closing quote):
  CREATE DOMAIN attachment AS jsonb CHECK (value ?& ARRAY['url', 'mime'] AND (value ->> 'url') ~ '^(https?)://[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*)
  ```
- **Error:** `PARSE ERROR: Unexpected token 'u', "unterminat"... is not valid JSON`

## Test Categories

- **Kitchen Sink Tests:** 251 test suites covering comprehensive SQL parsing scenarios
- **Original Tests:** PostgreSQL upstream test cases
- **Latest Tests:** Modern PostgreSQL feature tests  
- **Custom Tests:** LaunchQL-specific extensions and edge cases

## Test Framework Improvements

### Debugging Features Added
- Detailed SQL comparison logging showing input vs deparsed output
- Clear indication of exact vs different matches
- Enhanced error reporting with parse failure details

### Error Handling Fixed
- Async forEach converted to proper for-of loop
- Proper error propagation from async operations
- TypeScript error handling for diff function null cases

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Deparser Bug:** Address the missing quote issue in regex pattern handling
2. **Verify Fix:** Ensure the deparser properly handles escaped string literals
3. **Update Tests:** Confirm all tests pass after deparser fix
4. **Monitor Regressions:** Run full test suite after each change

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
cd packages/deparser
yarn test

# Run specific test
yarn test --testNamePattern="misc-launchql-ext-types"

# Watch mode for development
yarn test:watch
```

## Historical Context

This test status reflects the state after fixing a critical async forEach bug that was preventing the test framework from catching deparser failures. The one failing test now properly reveals a real issue that was previously hidden, demonstrating that the test framework fix is working as intended.
