## Deparser Tests

**254/254 tests passing (100%)**

All deparser tests are now passing successfully, including:
- PostgreSQL 17 features (GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY columns, UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT constraints)
- Three-part table names with catalogname support (catalog.schema.table)

The deparser has been updated to properly handle catalogname in RangeVar nodes for SQL statements like "SELECT * FROM foo.bar.baz".
