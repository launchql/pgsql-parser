## Deparser Tests

**254/254 tests passing (100%)**

All deparser tests are now passing successfully, including the PostgreSQL 17 features:
- GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY columns
- UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT constraints

The deparser has been updated to properly handle these new PostgreSQL 17 syntax features.
