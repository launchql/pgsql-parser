# PostgreSQL v15-to-v16 AST Transformer Status

## Current Status: **IN PROGRESS** üü°
- **Test Pass Rate**: 184/258 tests passing (71.3% success rate)
- **Branch**: `pg15-pg16-transformer` 
- **PR**: [#175](https://github.com/launchql/pgsql-parser/pull/175)

## Progress Summary
Started from a basic skeleton transformer and systematically implemented node wrapping and transformation logic across all node types. Made significant progress improving test pass rate from initial ~30% to current 71.3%.

## Key Achievements
- ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive node transformation methods for 100+ node types
- ‚úÖ Fixed node wrapping issues across SelectStmt, InsertStmt, UpdateStmt, DeleteStmt
- ‚úÖ Resolved PartitionSpec strategy mapping in CreateStmt method
- ‚úÖ Added proper Array handling to transform method for nested node processing
- ‚úÖ Established stable baseline of 184/258 tests passing locally

## Current Challenge: Negative Integer Transformation
**Root Issue**: PG15 produces `"ival": {}` (empty objects) where PG16 expects `"ival": {"ival": -3}` for negative integers in A_Const nodes.

**Analysis Completed**:
- Created detailed debug scripts to analyze transformation flow
- Identified that A_Const method calls `this.transform()` on empty ival objects
- Empty objects `{}` don't get routed to Integer method due to missing node wrapper structure
- Need targeted fix that distinguishes between zero values (should remain empty) and negative values (need nested structure)

**Attempted Solutions**:
- ‚ùå Broad A_Const fix (transforms all empty ival objects) - caused test pass rate to drop to 144/258
- ‚ùå Context-aware transformation - too complex, inconsistent results
- üîÑ Currently exploring more sophisticated approach

## Debug Tools Created
- `debug_transformation_flow_detailed.js` - Analyzes exact transformation flow for negative integers
- `debug_insert_negative.js` - Tests specific INSERT statement with negative value
- `debug_zero_vs_negative.js` - Compares zero vs negative value handling
- `debug_context_analysis.js` - Analyzes context-dependent transformation patterns

## Next Steps
1. Implement targeted A_Const fix that can distinguish between contexts where empty ival objects should be transformed vs. preserved
2. Test fix maintains 184/258 baseline while resolving negative integer cases
3. Verify specific failing test cases like `alter_table-234.sql`
4. Continue systematic improvement of remaining 74 failing tests

## Test Categories
- **Passing (184)**: Basic node transformations, most SQL constructs
- **Failing (74)**: Primarily negative integer transformations, some complex nested structures

## Technical Notes
- Following patterns from v13-to-v14 transformer as reference
- Focus only on v15-to-v16 transformer per user instructions
- Ignoring CI failures per user directive, focusing on local test improvements
- Maintaining systematic approach to avoid regressions
