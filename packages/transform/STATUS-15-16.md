# PostgreSQL v15-to-v16 AST Transformer Status

## Current Status: **STABLE BASELINE ACHIEVED** ðŸŸ¢
- **Test Pass Rate**: 194/258 tests passing (75.2% success rate)
- **Branch**: `transform/pg15-pg16` 
- **PR**: [#182](https://github.com/launchql/pgsql-parser/pull/182)

## Key Achievements
- âœ… Improved from 184 to 194 passing tests (+10 test improvement)
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive node transformation methods for 100+ node types
- âœ… Fixed node wrapping issues across SelectStmt, InsertStmt, UpdateStmt, DeleteStmt
- âœ… Resolved PartitionSpec strategy mapping in CreateStmt method
- âœ… Added proper Array handling to transform method for nested node processing
- âœ… Implemented context-aware Integer transformation logic for TypeName and DefineStmt contexts
- âœ… Added GrantRoleStmt admin_opt to opt field transformation
- âœ… Maintained stable baseline through multiple iterations without regressions

## Current Challenge: Remaining 64 Failing Tests
**Root Issue**: Need to identify conservative, surgical transformation opportunities that can improve test pass rate without causing regressions from the stable 194 baseline.

**Key Constraints**:
- Must work only with AST structure (no location or SQL string dependencies)
- Cannot cause regressions from 194 passing tests baseline
- Must implement extremely targeted fixes for specific contexts only
- Focus on local test improvements only (ignore CI failures)

## Strategic Plan for Improving Beyond 194 Passing Tests

### Approach: Conservative, Surgical Transformations
The goal is to incrementally improve the remaining 64 failing tests while maintaining the stable 194 baseline. Each improvement should target 5-10 additional passing tests per iteration.

### Phase 1: Analyze Specific Failing Test Patterns
1. **Individual Test Analysis**: Create targeted debug scripts for top failing tests:
   - `original/upstream/strings-165.sql` - FuncCall context transformations
   - `original/upstream/rangetypes-285.sql` - TypeName arrayBounds enhancements  
   - `original/upstream/numeric-549.sql` - Numeric context transformations
   - `original/upstream/alter_table-234.sql` - INSERT VALUES contexts

2. **Pattern Identification**: Look for common AST structures in failing tests that can be safely transformed without affecting passing tests

3. **Context Detection**: Develop highly specific context detection methods that can distinguish transformation-worthy cases

### Phase 2: Implement Targeted Fixes
1. **Conservative Conditions**: Add extremely specific transformation conditions that only apply to well-defined contexts
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test each fix individually to ensure no regressions from 194 baseline
3. **Rollback Strategy**: Immediately revert any changes that cause test count to decrease

### Phase 3: Systematic Improvement
1. **Target Categories**: Focus on specific failing test categories one at a time
2. **Verification**: Run full test suite after each change to confirm improvements
3. **Documentation**: Update this status file with each successful improvement

## Current Test Status: 194 passing, 64 failed, 258 total

## Key Constraints
- **No Regressions**: Must maintain 194 passing tests baseline at all times
- **AST-Only**: Work only with AST structure, no location or SQL string dependencies  
- **Local Focus**: Ignore CI failures, focus purely on local test improvements
- **Conservative Approach**: Implement only extremely targeted, well-defined transformations

## Success Metrics
- Target: 210+ passing tests (16+ test improvement from current baseline)
- Method: Incremental improvements of 5-10 tests per iteration
- Verification: Full test suite validation after each change
