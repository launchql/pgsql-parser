/**
 * Direct transformers for specific version upgrades to PG17
 * 
 * These transformers are optimized for tree-shaking, allowing users to import
 * only the specific transformer they need without pulling in unnecessary code.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * ```typescript
 * // Import only the transformer you need
 * import { PG15ToPG17Transformer } from '@pgsql/transform/transformers-direct/v15-to-v17';
 * 
 * const transformer = new PG15ToPG17Transformer();
 * const pg17Ast = transformer.transform(pg15ParseResult);
 * ```
